console.log("Vaiables are the containers")
console.log("JS allows changing the value as well as the data type of variables at run time -")
let a = 67 // here the value of a is 67
console.log(a)
a = "Hey there"  // now it becomes Hey there
console.log(a)
// Rules are :-
// Letters, digits, underscores & $ sign allowed
// can't start with digits 
// reserved words( keywords) are not used
// case sensitive
// let 5=a  will throw an error

// Difference b/w var, let, const
// 'const' is used for declaring constant values to a container that can neither be updated nor declared again
// 'var' is used for doing these two purposes
// 'let' is used in cases where we can update the value of variable but can not re-declare it

// using var
var b = 5
{
    var b = "this is the new value b holds"
    console.log(b)
}
console.log(b) // since b is redeclared it will also print the new b value

// using let
let c = "Good Morning"
{
    let c = "Hello"
    console.log(c)
}
console.log(c) // in this case it still holds the original value

// the main reason for the above differences is that var has a global scope while let has a scope limited to block

// const variables must be defined at the time of declaration and can't be initialized with null value 
// const d = 0 will throw an error
// const d
// d=0  will also throw an error

{
    let d
    d = 7
    console.log(d)
}
{
    var e
    e = 8
    console.log(e)
}
// these two cases are valid
